# moteurDeRechercheJava

Overview
This project is a mini search engine built using Java, developed as part of coursework at the National Engineering School of Tunis (ENIT). The engine utilizes indexing, scoring, and personalization techniques to deliver relevant and tailored search results.

The core concepts implemented in this project include:

Indexing for efficient document retrieval.
(Term Frequency and others) for ranking document relevance.
User Profiling for search result personalization.
Java Collections and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to manage data and improve performance.
Features
Inverted Index: Allows quick retrieval of documents based on search queries.
 Scoring: Ranks the importance of a term within a document relative to the entire dataset.
Personalized Results: Customizes search output based on user preferences and history.
Optimized Complexity: Uses various Java collections (HashMap, Tree, List) to reduce time and space complexity.
